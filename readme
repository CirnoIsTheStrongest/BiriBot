BiriBot is a shiny Python IRC framework. Currently not much to it of interest, but I plan
on it being an event driven, highly modular framework to be easily extended in the future.
Currently only has a last.fm now playing module. All settings are saved/loaded in the
settings.json file. update your settings and run core.py to start.

Usage:

'.alias <nick>' adds an alias for your nick to the last.fm user <nick>
'.np <nick>' checks the last.fm api for the given <nick>'s currently playing track
'.compare <nick>' or '.compare <nick> <nick>' compares two nicknames last.fm compatibility.
the first compares your IRC username or it's aliased one to the given <nick>, the second
compares two given nicknames.
'.join <channel>' joins the given <channel>
'.part <channel>' parts the given <channel>
'.exit'  closes the open socket and disconnects from the server -> responds only to the botowner
'.say <location> <message>' messages the given channel/username (<location>) with the
specified <message>
