BiriBot is a shiny Python IRC framework. Currently not much to it of interest, but I plan
on it being an event driven, highly modular framework to be easily extended in the future.
Currently only has a last.fm now playing module. All settings are saved/loaded in the
settings.json file. update your settings and run core.py to start.
